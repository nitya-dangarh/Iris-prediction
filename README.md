ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Species Detection using CNN in Python
A machine learning project to classify Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model in Python. This project is built on the classic Iris dataset, a popular dataset for classification tasks.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how deep learning techniques, particularly CNNs, can be used to solve a multiclass classification problem. The model is trained to recognize patterns from sepal and petal measurements and predict the correct species.
